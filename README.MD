# Template for TDD/BDD Javascript

This is a template useful to get started quickly. It takes care of setting up
all of the boilerplate needed.

## Requirements

This code has the following requirements:

  - nodejs installed, at least version 12.2.0
  - npm installed, at least version 6.9.0

The remaining requirements will be installed in the next section.

## Setting up

Before running the code or the tests, make sure to install the required _npm_ libraries:

```bash
npm i
```

This will download and install the libraries from the remote _npm_ registry, so _make sure
you have a working internet connection_.

## Running the code

To run the code execute:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running the BDD tests

You can easily run the BDD tests by executing:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running the Unit tests

You can run the unit tests by running:

```bash
npm run dev:test
```

The results of the tests will be shown as the *specs* are run.
